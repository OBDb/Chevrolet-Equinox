generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2009
    description: "The original Chevrolet Equinox was a mid-size crossover SUV built on GM's Theta platform (GMT191). Produced from January 2004 to May 2009 (model years 2005-2009), it featured a spacious interior with a unique sliding rear bench seat dubbed 'Multi-Flex' that could adjust to prioritize either passenger or cargo space. Power came from a 3.4L V6 engine producing 185 HP, paired with a five-speed automatic transmission and available in front or all-wheel drive configurations. Starting in 2008, a more powerful 3.6L V6 producing 264 HP became available. The first-generation Equinox established the nameplate as an important part of Chevrolet's lineup during the growing transition from traditional SUVs to car-based crossovers. A mechanical twin, the Pontiac Torrent, shared the same platform from 2006-2009."

    description: "The second-generation Equinox (2010-2015) was built on an improved version of the Theta platform (GMT172) and debuted in June 2009 for the 2010 model year. It featured significantly improved styling, interior quality, and efficiency compared to the first generation. Initially powered by a standard 2.4L four-cylinder or optional 3.0L V6 (later upgraded to a 3.6L), all engines featured direct injection for improved performance and fuel economy. Notable features included an available powered liftgate, advanced audio system with MyLink telematics (from 2012), and a rear-seat entertainment system. Safety was enhanced with standard stability control and available forward collision alert and lane departure warning. This generation was assembled at multiple plants: Ingersoll and Oshawa in Ontario, Canada, and Spring Hill, Tennessee in the United States."

This facelift introduced a completely new grille, redesigned headlights, new wheels, and updated front and rear fascias with reworked tail lights. The interior was refined with a new gear selector, additional storage, and removal of dashboard door lock buttons. Trim consolidation occurred, with 1LT and 2LT merging into a single LT trim. Front-wheel-drive models could no longer be had with the 3.6-liter V6 engine. All Equinox trims now featured projector-style headlights, backup camera, and the Chevrolet MyLink 7-inch touchscreen as standard. For 2017, the final model year of this generation, two new appearance packages were introduced: Midnight Edition and Sport package, both with black 18-inch aluminum wheels and darkened exterior accents. The LTZ trim was renamed Premier."

    description: "The third-generation Equinox (2018-2021) was unveiled on September 22, 2016, and went on sale in early 2017 for gasoline variants and fall 2017 for diesel variants. Built on the GM Delta (D2XX) platform, this generation was downsized to compete in the compact crossover SUV segment, losing approximately 400 pounds compared to the second generation. The exterior design featured sharper, more modern styling aligned with Chevrolet's contemporary design language. Engine options included a 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder (standard), a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder (2018-2020), and a 1.6L turbodiesel (2018-2019, discontinued due to low demand). All were paired with either a 6-speed or 9-speed automatic transmission. The interior offered enhanced materials, design, and technology, including standard 7-8 inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Safety technology expanded to include automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist, and adaptive cruise control on higher trims.

The 2022 facelift featured a redesigned front grille integrated with updated headlamps, restyled lower fascia with new fog lamps, and redesigned rear bumper and tail lamps. The interior was refined with redesigned cloth seats featuring a zig-zag pattern, and all models now featured wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay with an auto stop-start deactivation switch. Trim levels changed with the introduction of the RS trim (sport-centric variant), while the base L trim was dropped, making LS the base model. The 2.0L turbocharged engine was discontinued. For 2023, the 1.5L turbo engine was upgraded to the new LSD variant with higher fuel injection pressure and improved efficiency, gaining 5 HP (175 HP total). Electro-hydraulic brakes were introduced, and Midnight and Sport editions returned on the LS trim. Production continued at the same facilities through 2024."

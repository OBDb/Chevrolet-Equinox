## Generations

The Chevrolet Equinox has gone through several generations since its introduction:

- **First Generation (2005-2009)**: The original Equinox was introduced as a mid-size crossover SUV on GM's Theta platform. It featured a 3.4L V6 engine producing 185 hp, with both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive options available. This generation established the Equinox as Chevrolet's entry in the growing crossover segment.

- **Second Generation (2010-2017)**: The second-generation Equinox was redesigned to be slightly smaller than its predecessor. Engine options included a 2.4L four-cylinder and a 3.0L V6 (later upgraded to a 3.6L). This generation introduced more modern features and improved fuel economy, with a significant refresh in 2016 that updated the exterior styling and interior technology.

- **Third Generation (2018-2023)**: The third-generation Equinox was downsized to the compact crossover segment. It offered a 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder as the base engine, with optional 2.0L turbo and 1.6L turbo-diesel engines (both later discontinued). This generation featured increased technology integration, improved safety features, and more refined styling.

- **Fourth Generation (2024-present)**: The latest generation Equinox received a complete redesign with more modern styling, updated technology features, and improved interior quality. Chevrolet also introduced an all-electric Equinox EV alongside the gasoline version, positioning the model for the future of automotive electrification.
